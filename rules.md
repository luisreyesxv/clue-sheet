## Set UP

1. Pick 2 packs and shuffle them together. This is your library for the game.

2. Take the 21 Evidence cards and separate them into 3 piles:
    - Hackers (blue cards)
    - Virus (purple cards)
    - Programs (orange cards)

3. Shuffle each pile and place them face down. Pick the top card from each of the 3 piles and place them into the **Case File Envelope** so no one (including you) can see whats inside

4. Reveal the top 2 cards from the **Program** pile and reveal them. This is public information for the game. (Players should mark these cards down)

5. Shuffle the remaining **Hacker**, **virus**, and **Program** cards into one pile and deal them face down to each player. Each player should keep these cards hidden from the other players

6. Hand out a notepad to everyone so they can record evidence and narrow down what the cards must be in the **Case File Envelope**

## Gameplay

This is a normal game of MTG with the additional rules:

- Everyone starts the game with 30 life.

- Whenever one or more creatures you control deal combat damage to a player, you **MUST** make a **Suggestion** towards that player.  That player then secretly shows you one of the **Evidence Cards** from your **Suggestion**, if they have one. if they have more than one card, they choose which to show you.

- If your creature(s) deal combat damage to multiple players at the same time and you make a **Suggestion**, the player closest to your left that was dealt damage shows you an **Evidence Card** from your **Suggestion**, if possible. if they can't, then the next player to the left that was dealt damage must attempt to showyou a card,and so on, continuing clockwise around the table until a player shows you a card or all players that were dealt damage have attempted to show one.

- At the begining of your end step, if you haven't made a **Suggestion**, you may exile cards with total mana value 6 or greater from your graveyard to do so. If you do, follow the rules above as if you had dealt combat damage to each other player at the same time.

- Whenever you show an **Evidence Card** to another player, you create a **Treasure Token**. This token is an artifact you can tap and sacrifice to add one mana of any color.

- If you lose the game, receal your evidence cards to all players

- Think you know wohdunnit? At the beginning of your end step, After any **Suggestions** have been made, you can make an **Accusation** to solve the case. Say *"I'm accusing the <span style="background: blue; color: white">*HACKER*</span> group of hacking <span style="background: orange; color: white"> *PROGRAM*</span> with the <span style="background: purple; color: white">*VIRUS*</span> virus!!"* . Then check the **Case File Envelope** without letting other players see the **Evidence Cards** inside. **YOU CAN MAKE ONLY ONE ACCUSATION PER GAME, SO BE CAREFUL**

- If you named all three **Evidence Cards** inside the 88Case File Envelope** correctly, reveal them. **You win the game!**

- If your **Accusation** was wrong, put the cards back in the envelope while keepign them hidden from the other players. You can't make **Suggestions** or **Accusations** for the rest of the game, **but you must still respond to any from other players.

**Even though you can't solve the muder, you can still win the game by reducing the life totals of the other players to 0!**
