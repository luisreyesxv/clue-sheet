## Quick Glance

 - Start with 30 Life
 - Everyone has Alt Win condition by guessing the 3 cards with an **Accusation**
 - You can make Accusation at the end of your turn after all suggestions have been made.
 - You can only make 1 **Accusation** per game. Not allowed to reveal what you saw
 - When you dealt combat damage to a player, you can give a **Suggestion**
 - If you haven't made a suggestion by the end of your turn, you can make a special **Suggestion** by exiling cards worth 6 mana from your graveyard. This suggestion is made to everyone and asked in clock-wise order
 - When a **Suggestion** has been made against you and you revealed a card, you create a **Treasure Token**
