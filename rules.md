## Quick Glance

 - Start with 30 Life
 - Everyone has Alt Win condition by guessing the 3 cards with an **Accusation**
 - You can make Accusation at the end of your turn after all suggestions have been made.
 - You can only make 1 **Accusation** per game. Not allowed to reveal what you saw
 - When you dealt combat damage to a player, you can give a **Suggestion**
 - If you haven't made a suggestion by the end of your turn, you can make a special **Suggestion** by exiling cards worth 6 mana from your graveyard. This suggestion is made to everyone and asked in clock-wise order
 - When a **Suggestion** has been made against you and you revealed a card, you create a **Treasure Token**

## Set UP

1) Pick 2 packs and shuffle them together. This is your library for the game.
2) Take the 21 Evidence cards and separate them into 3 piles:
    - Hackers (blue cards)
    - Virus (purple cards)
    - Programs (orange cards)

3) Shuffle each pile and place them face down. Pick the top card from each of the 3 piles and place them into the **Case File Envelope** so no one (including you) can see whats inside
4) Reveal the top 2 cards from the **Program** pile and reveal them. This is public information for the game. (Players should mark these cards down)
5) Shuffle the remaining **Hacker**, **virus**, and **Program** cards into one pile and deal them face down to each player. Each player should keep these cards hidden from the other players
6) Hand out a notepad to everyone so they can record evidence and narrow down what the cards must be in the **Case File nvelope**
